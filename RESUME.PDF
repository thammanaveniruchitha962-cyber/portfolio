REAL TIME PROJECT: AUTOMATIC CALL NOTIFICATION 
The objective of the project is the Automatic Call Notification project aims to send a message 
automatically when someone is unable to answer a call, without relying on mobile devices. This is 
useful in situations like: - Busy or emergency situations where answering calls isn't possible. - Offices 
or workplaces with landline phones. - Situations where mobile phones are not allowed or are out of 
reach. The system would detect when a call is missed or unanswered and trigger an automated 
message to the caller, providing an alternative contact method or a custom message. Some possible 
technologies to achieve this include: - Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) - Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR) systems - Cloud-based telephony platforms like Twilio or Nexmo - Integration with 
existing PBX or phone systems.
